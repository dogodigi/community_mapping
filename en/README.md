## Preface
The book can be used as teaching material, preferably for a 5 day program to engage people into community mapping and discover the economic potential of community mapping.

People can get involved into community mapping without prerequisits. The only technical skills needed are the basic ability to operate a computer or mobile device. 

Part of this book is targeted at web developers. When developer skills (basic knowledge of html, css and javascript) are required, this is clearly stated at the start of the chapter as: "__advanced__ skills required".
