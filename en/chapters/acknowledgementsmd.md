# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the OpenStreetMap community and the Wikipedia community for the wonderful online information sources they provide to learn everything that is required for community mapping. 

We would like to thank the Interactive Community Mappers of August Town, Jamaica for their great work, enthousiasm and the stories they share. Without them, this would not have been possible.

The author of this document would also like to thank Ace Suares for inviting him to Cura√ßao to do the first community mapping project, Professor [Sameer Verma](http://verma.sfsu.edu/profile/index.html) for bringing him in touch with Jamaica and the Mona School of Business And Management for enabling the August Town Interactive Community Mapping Project.
