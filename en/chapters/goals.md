# Goals

In the course, students will learn how to:


 1. Produce media-rich community map artifacts
 2. Use OpenStreetMap as an effective map-based open data platform
 3. Create their first application with the geodata the surveyed

At the end of the course, we will evaluate the potential for this approach to become a sustainable initiative that can support community tourism and provide economic lift to communities; enhance tourism product information and diversity of choices; provide innovation opportunities for software developers and other service entrepreneurs.
