# OpenStreetMap

## Summary
Attendees will learn about computer systems for geodata and OpenStreetMap in particular. After this lecture they will know what OpenStreetMap is and the possibilities it offers.

## Geodata in computersystems

There are institutions and companies that have had a need for geodata since the first days of computers. 

- Land Register
- Postal services
- Shipping authorities
- Weather institutes
- Trucking companies
- Military
- and more

> ##### exercise 13
> Discuss the various institutions and companies. What geodata are they using? How important is it for their operation?

When programming became a profession, computer companies started creating computer systems that can:
- Store geodata
- Perform mathematics on geodata
- Visualize geodata

## Economic value
Soon companies realized geodata had economic value. The postal services started selling postalcode datasets. Governments often charged a fee for accessing geodata like land registration records. 

Companies emerged that where specialized in navigation. They bought geodata from governments and companies (at great cost), processed the data and created products. At first this where CD roms that could be used on desktop computers, later they created mobile navigation devices.

Geodata has always been costly. It required intensive labor to gather. Only those who could invest the money needed to create or buy geodata could create products and make a business.

> ##### exercise 14
> Do you know the what a roadmap for your country will cost you? And a navigation device for your car?
> ##### exercise 15
> How many people live in your country? If 10% of people in your country buy one roadmap every two years, what revenue will it generate per year?

## Government geodata

Some countries have specialized agencies that collect, store and visualize geodata. In the Netherlands, this was the topographic service which stems from the military and later merged into the "Kadaster" the dutch land register. In the United Kingdom, this is [Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/).

> ##### exercise 16
> What is the name of the agency in your country that collects and serves the government with geodata? Is it a public or commercial agency?

> ##### exercise 17
> Visit the website of your national mapping agency. What do they charge for geodata? Imagine you want to create a map of all parcels on the island. What would it cost you?

## Why OpenStreetMap began

In 2004, a young student in the UK named [Steve Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coast), found that there was a lack of available map and location data in the UK. However, there was this newly emerging information tool called Wikipedia that was slowly becoming a powerhouse. Based on its model and success, Steve was inspired to create its counterpart with respect to maps.

His eventual aim? To map the entire planet and make the data freely available, without copyright restrictions, for everyone with an internet connection to use in a multitude of ways.
