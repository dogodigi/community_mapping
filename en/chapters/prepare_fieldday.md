# Prepare a field day

## Objective

After the preparation, students know what they need to prepare and take with them on a field day.

## Materials and equipment

- students should all have a smartphone. 
- A printer that can be used from a computer with internet access is required to generate paper maps for the field day.
- Clipboards, preferably one per 2 students for the field day.
- Pen or pencil.

----

Select an area to map. Ask the students if they have a preference. Use [openstreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) to check if the area contains enough blindspots to map. Or if they don't, discuss why the area could still be interesting. Try to keep the area smaller then a square mile. When consensus is reached, select gathering points. Make sure you set a start and end time. Create room for pauses and discussion. Make sure the students bring enough to drink and eat. You can even organize a lunch.

### Smartphone
Make sure all students have a smartphone with:
  - a camera
  - gps
  - gps enabled for the camera
  - gps logger software installed and working
 
### Fieldpapers

Once the area is selected, you create prints from the [fieldpapers](http://www.fieldpapers.org) website. Hand the prints to the students. It would be best to also hand out clipboards as the students will be sketching and writing on the print when they are on the field day.

### General

Tell the students to take pictures!
