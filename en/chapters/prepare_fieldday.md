# Preparation

Select an area to map. Ask the attendees if they have a preference. Use [openstreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) to check if the area contains enough blindspots to map. Or if they don't, discuss why the area could still be interesting. Try to keep the area smaller then a square mile. When consensus is reached, select gathering points. Make sure you set a start and end time. Create room for pauses and discussion. Make sure the attendees bring enough to drink and eat. You can even organize a lunch.

## Requirements
### Smartphone
Make sure all attendees have a smartphone with:
  - a camera
  - gps
  - gps enabled for the camera
  - gps logger software installed and working
 
### Fieldpapers

Once the area is selected, you create prints from the [fieldpapers](http://www.fieldpapers.org) website. Hand the prints to the attendees. It would be best to also hand out clipboards as the attendees will be sketching and writing on the print when they are on the field day.

### General

Tell the attendees to take pictures!
