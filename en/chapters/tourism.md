# Opportunities in tourism

In general, statistics shows that tourism is still [expanding](http://visual.ly/tourism) (more [here](http://media.unwto.org/content/infographics)). Most modern travelers use a lot of [technology](http://www.tourism-review.com/infographics/tech_influence.jpg). But we can differentiate tourist and travelers based upon their [needs](http://www.theplaidzebra.com/how-to-spot-the-difference-between-a-tourist-and-a-traveller/). Some say that [Social media](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-media-travel-hospitality/466163) influences travelers behaviour greatly. Peer reviews are becoming a great influencer which actually makes people decide to visit, or not. Mapping and a well known, detailed, mapped environment can create great advantages.
