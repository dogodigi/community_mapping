# Using fieldpapers

In this chapter we will see how we can record the coordinates of places without a GPS. We will use a tool called Field Papers, which allows you to print a map of an area, draw on it and add notes, and load the paper back into JOSM, where you can add your locations to OpenStreetMap. You can also watch this 8-minute Tutorial Field Papers video on how to create an atlas and upload a snapshot.
