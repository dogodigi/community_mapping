The students can also watch an instruction video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HGkBXZ69g)

Fieldpapers can be used to sketch the situation outside on a piece of paper and later use them to create objects in OpenStreetMap. Fieldpapers allows you to print a map of an area, draw on it and add notes, and load the paper back into your editor.

There is an 8-minute [video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HGkBXZ69g&feature=youtu.be) on Fieldpapers. The [Fieldpapers](http://fieldpapers.org) website has clear instructions on the process.

## Download and print
On the fieldpapers website you first need to make an _atlas_, an atlas is a collection of adjecent rectangles that, once you press the _MAKE ATLAS_ button on the fieldpapers website render the map rectangles and give you the ability to export them as PDF for printing. Make sure you zoom in far enough and check the PDF before printing. Take into account that the atlas should contain enough detail to be sketched upon and that the area represented in the rectangle should not be to big or small to walk during a field day. Don't worry if you do not get it right straight away.

## Go out and map

Simply print the atlas once you are satisfied and distribute the prints amongst the participants that will be at the field day. It is best to work in small groups, 2 or 3 persons. Where one can do the sketching and another one can take pictures. Map as much as is relevant and possible. You can for instance take streetnames from signs, housenumbers, shop names and opening hours. If it is possible to walk around a lake or building, try to sketch the contours as good as possible. When you are walking along roads, can you identify their class? Are they highways or residential? Or are they tracks that are unpaved?

It is best to take a clipboard with you when using fieldpapers, the hard underground will make it much easier to sketch. It is also good to work in groups and help each other notice the relevant features outside. Mapping with fieldpaper is fun and a truly social activity!
