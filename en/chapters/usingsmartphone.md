# Using your smart phone

## Objective

Students will learn how to use their smartphones for mapping.

## Materials and equipment

- Smartphone.
- The possibility to install applications either via f-droid, google play, iTunes or the windows phone repository.

----


Your smartphone is a powerful computer! It can help you when you are on a field day in a couple of ways.
- You can log your walk in GPS track(s)
- You can take location aware pictures
- You can record audio

## GPS tracks
There are a lot of different applications for Android and iOS available to record GPS tracks. The most important is that you need them to store the recordings as GPX files that you can copy from your smartphone to your computer later.

### Android
For Android, you can download the (open source) _Mendhak GPS logger for Android_ via [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger&hl=en) or [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=gps+logger&fdid=com.mendhak.gpslogger). (More applications are listed on the OpenStreetMap [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android#Track-making_features)).

### iOS
For iOS, most GPS loggers are paid or require you to make in-application purchases to export GPX files. [Trails](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trails-outdoor-gps-logbook/id913277014?mt=8) looks free and has some good GPX file features. (More applications are listed on the OpenStreetMap [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple_iOS#Track_making_features)).

### Windows Phone
For the Windows Phone, there is a list of possible applications on the OpenStreetMap [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Windows_Phone#Track_making_features).


> ##### Check
The teacher and students can help each other to download a GPS application that can log GPX tracks. Check to make sure that the application can generate GPX files. Record a test file. See if and where it is stored on the smartphone.

## Location aware media

Probably all students know how to take picture with their smartphones. But did you know that you can add location information to a picture, video or soundrecording? You simply need to allow your smartphone to use the position from the GPS when taking pictures or recording.

The location data is (among other data) stored in [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format) metadata with your file. It is not an extra file, it is _inside_ your file. Most media websites, like Youtube, Flickr and Instagram will know how to process the EXIF information which makes it possible to show your files on the map.

> ##### Check
The teacher and students can help each other to enable GPS for their smartphone camera. Take your time, check thoroughly and see if the location icon turns on when taking pictures. If necessary, check outside the classroom if there is no GPS coverage inside.

## Audio recording

In OpenStreetMap this is called [audio mapping](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Audio_mapping) the wiki page at OpenStreetMap will give good information. Let the students read it or explain it to them. Then they can experiment with recording sound the same way they experimented with GPS tracks and Media.

> ##### Check
> Experiment with the various tools. Make sure students know how to operate the various aspects.
