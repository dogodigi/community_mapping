# Using your smart phone

## Objective

Students will learn how to use their smartphones for mapping.

## Materials and equipment

- Smartphone.
- The possibility to install applications either via f-droid, google play, iTunes or the windows phone repository.

----


Your smartphone is a powerful computer! It can help you when you are on a field day in a couple of ways.
- You can log your walk in GPS track(s)
- - You can take location aware pictures
- You can record voice memo's, in OpenStreetMap this is called [audio mapping](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Audio_mapping) but we will skip this topic for now.

## GPS tracks
There are a lot of different applications for Android and iOS available to record GPS tracks. The most important is that you need them to store the recordings as GPX files that you can copy from your smartphone to your computer later.

### Android
For Android, you can download the (open source) _Mendhak GPS logger for Android_ via [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger&hl=en) or [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=gps+logger&fdid=com.mendhak.gpslogger). (More applications are listed on the OpenStreetMap [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android#Track-making_features)).

### iOS
For iOS, most GPS loggers are paid or require you to make in-application purchases to export GPX files. [Trails](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trails-outdoor-gps-logbook/id913277014?mt=8) looks free and has some good GPX file features. (More applications are listed on the OpenStreetMap [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple_iOS#Track_making_features)).

### Windows Phone
For the Windows Phone, there is a list of possible applications on the OpenStreetMap [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Windows_Phone#Track_making_features).

## Location aware pictures

Probably all students know how to take picture with their smartphones. But did you know that you can add location information to a picture? You simply need to allow your smartphone to use the position from the GPS when taking pictures.

### Android

### iOS

### Windows Phone
