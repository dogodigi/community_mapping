----

We have now editted and entered information through the OpenStreetMap editor and saved our work. OpenStreetMap will need a little time to process the information on the map, but the data is already there. When using the _export_ function from the OpenStreetMap website, you __will__ get your edits the main map will mostly update in 5 to 25 minutes, you may need to refresh the browser for that.
