# Why?

There is a lot of economic value in geodata. See for example [this infographic by Oxera](http://www.oxera.com/Oxera/media/Oxera/images/Oxera-Geo-Services.jpg).

Often this value is in the hands of large corporations. We want to bring this power into the hands of communities. Community mapping is al about having knowleddge of your surroundings. And who knows better then the people that live in an area?

Interactive Community Mapping is a form of [Crowdsourcing]() where the difference is in using whatever resources you have to create great results. With regards to Interactive Community Mapping, crowdsourced Citizen Data is created from maps, social media, connecting to web applications and creating media content like photo and video.

The local community evaluates and validates the data and enhances it greatly with their knowledge about the local situation, events and points that can be of interest to the community or the greater public.

All this combined knowledge offers opportunities. Especially for the interactive form of tourism that is emerging rapidly. Travelers are not interested in full-service resorts. They want to connect with the people and the land. They seek opportunities to "stay with locals", share their meals, learn their customs. Today communities are no longer dependent on large travel agencies but can organize their own tourism by providing information on the internet, provide housing and tell the world about events and points of interest.

Interactive Community Mapping is a joint effort, where the governments and officials can operate as enablers and facilitate by providing tourism related facts and figures, map data and perspective.
